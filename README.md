to be honest i dont think that 6 7 means something, as i knwo is only a meme 
A lot of student use it, but they say it randomly, 
and when tey say it they change their voice tone, they make it more slow 
i think it will be in school culture because is something really popular 
i heart it even out of the school all day.

to be honest i think cell phones new police will hwlp students to do not distract them selves,
but i dont think that is good that we can use like in lunch or when we are done with our assigment, i will allow games in computers 
because sometimes we are bored and we need a distrction

i think that if SNAO runs out of funding it will a problem, becauase if many people use it, and it's helps many persosn, technology will be a good help for them, because people can look, can try to find another places that help them, but also it can be difficult for many people to can use, maybe they dot have a cellphone or or not internet accces, 
if i could create something that could help people i'm not sure abaut the name but i will put in like in a public are and free for who really need it.

i think that the technology changed the way people celebrate and conect, not only in holidays, in every party or celebration that they had, technology help people when they are in a long dinstance, that way they can be kind of conected, and see how is it going, i don't thingk that it make it worse or better, i mean, it cab be helpful and can help people to conect when they can't be there, in my opinion the developers do no should ne responsibles for making shure that it a 100% works in a holiday.

i think the car can not recognize the stop sing because ca not determine what kind of sing is that, like what is that for or something like that, the camaras oor the AI should like analize or determine the sing, like seening that is an stop sing, if i can i add a reader, i mean like that the AI could read STOP on thr sing and automatically stop.
