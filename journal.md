The New Cell Phone Law
I think that the new law can be good but at the same time bad, it totally help the estudents to pay attention, and to spend less time in their cellphones, and also to be more sociables.
but it aslo has contras, for example, i remember that when i come from the first time to a USA achool, i did not eany eanglish, and a had to use my phone to trasnlate, to can talk waith my teachers, so people who comw for another country and does not any ensglish it can kind of hard to them.
also we can't even hear music,and can't usea another electronuc device.

In the video we can learn that computer of science is usseful in so many things that we can even image, people ise it in their works every dat without notice.
in the video the people tell us how they use it, also we can see many ways in how it is helpful, in art, in medicine, in security, all the people use it in different ways,
but they use it.
i think it is important for the people to know how to use it, inmean not to be a expert person with that, but have a litte bit of knowlag eabaut that,
because of my point of view it can help us one day in some way, or for the persons who are interested in study something relationated with that,
i think is a good thimg to learn, and also it can be helful.
