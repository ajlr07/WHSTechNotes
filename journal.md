The New Cell Phone Law
I think that the new law can be good but at the same time bad, it totally help the estudents to pay attention, and to spend less time in their cellphones, and also to be more sociables.
but it aslo has contras, for example, i remember that when i come from the first time to a USA achool, i did not eany eanglish, and a had to use my phone to trasnlate, to can talk waith my teachers, so people who comw for another country and does not any ensglish it can kind of hard to them.
also we can't even hear music,and can't usea another electronuc device.
